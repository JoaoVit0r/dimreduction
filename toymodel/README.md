# Toymodel Usage and Validation

This folder provides a minimal working example (toy model) for running the project with a small dataset (40 genes).

## Contents

- `processed_dataset_dream5_40.csv`: The toy dataset (copied from `inputs_files/datasets/`).
- `40-gui-final_data.txt`: Reference output for final data (copied from `references/final_data/`).
- `40-gui-quantized_data.txt`: Reference output for quantized data (copied from `inputs_files/quantized_data/`).
- `.env.toymodel.example`: Example environment file for running the toy model (copy to `dimreduction-java/.env`).
- `setup_and_test_toymodel.sh`: Script to set up the environment, run the project, and validate results.

## How to Use

1. **Copy the example environment file:**

   ```sh
   cp toymodel/.env.toymodel.example dimreduction-java/.env
   ```

   Or run the provided script (see below).

2. **Run the setup and test script:**

   ```sh
   bash toymodel/setup_and_test_toymodel.sh
   ```

   This will:
   - Copy the example `.env` file to `dimreduction-java/.env`.
   - Run the project using the toy dataset.
   - Compare the output to the expected results in `toymodel/40-gui-final_data.txt` and `toymodel/40-gui-quantized_data.txt`.
   - Report if your environment is ready.

## How to Confirm Results

- The script will automatically compare the output files generated by the project with the expected reference files in the `toymodel/` folder.
- If the outputs match, your environment is ready to use!
- If there are differences, the script will show a diff so you can investigate further.

## Expected Outputs

- **Final data:** Should match `toymodel/40-gui-final_data.txt`
- **Quantized data:** Should match `toymodel/40-gui-quantized_data.txt`
